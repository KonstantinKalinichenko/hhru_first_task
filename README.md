**The text of the first task:**
The teacher sent the students the grade reports for the exam. Determine which students scored a passing grade: 35 points or more. The maximum score for the exam is 55 points. If no one scored a passing grade, return 'None passed the exam'.

**Input format:**
Two lines. The first line contains integers representing the students' scores (0 ≤ x ≤ 55), separated by commas. The second line contains the students' names, also separated by commas. It is guaranteed that the number of scores and names in the two lines is the same.
